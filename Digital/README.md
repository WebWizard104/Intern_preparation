### 🧩 **Topic-wise Resources and Practice**  

#### 1️⃣ **Combinational and Sequential Circuits**  
- 📖 Refer to [Mano Digital Design 5E](https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/Mano%20Digital%20Design%205E.pdf). Cover chapters 1-7 and solve the end-of-chapter questions.  
- 📝 Practice additional questions from [DIGIQS](https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/DIGIQS.pdf).  

#### 2️⃣ **Static Time Analysis (STA)**  
- 🎥 Watch this [YouTube Playlist on STA](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpCkjM331Aa8JNoZ1s1o1txve2wlf9pCP&si=RLKsbN1wS-iMU1rW).  
- 📝 Practice STA problems from [DIGIQS](https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/DIGIQS.pdf).  

#### 3️⃣ **FIFO Depth Calculation**  
- 📖 Study specific cases from [this PDF](https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/fifodepthcalculationmadeeasy2%20.pdf).  
- 📝 Practice problems for each case.  

#### 4️⃣ **Fault Analysis and Hazards**  
*Coming Soon!*  

#### 5️⃣ **CMOS**  
- 🎥 Refer to [Digital IC Design by Prof. Janakiraman](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHO2NKv71TvsSqYwVvUCZwNkY-jUyUHdS&si=SVGbxXnJIJatscRN).  
  - Time-constrained? Cover the first 19 lectures.  
  - Have more time? Watch the entire playlist and practice problems.  

#### 6️⃣ **Memory (RAM, ROM, etc.)**  
- 📖 Refer to Chapter 7 of [Mano Digital Design](https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/Mano%20Digital%20Design%205E.pdf).  
- 🎥 Alternatively, watch lectures 23-25 of this [COA Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-8LShlBMIjUuI9beQJHZUF14we25NToB).  

#### 7️⃣ **Programmable Devices**  
- 📺 Check out Neso Academy videos for clear explanations.  

#### 8️⃣ **Verilog**  
- 🎥 If you have ample time, follow the course by [Prof. Indranil Sen Gupta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCrlyaXMAn8&list=PLRsFfXmDi9IYCNlvNjrsD8bLMmNE0UxBH).  
- ⏳ Time-constrained? Refer to syntax videos on YouTube and solve HDL problems in the last section of each chapter in Morris Mano.  

#### 9️⃣ **Computer Organization and Architecture (COA)**  
- 🎥 Study this [COA Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-8LShlBMIjUuI9beQJHZUF14we25NToB).  
  - Main topics to cover:  
    1. ISA, Addressing modes  
    2. CISC, RISC  
    3. Performance Benchmarks  
    4. Amdahl's Law  
    5. Memory Interfacing and Addressing  
    6. Memory Hierarchy and Cache Memory (Very important)  
    7. Pipelining  
    8. Pipeline Hazards  
- ⏳ Time-constrained? Follow Gate Smashers’ COA course and practice previous years' GATE questions.  

#### 🔟 **Programming**  
- For C++:  
  - Topics to cover:  
    1. Keywords  
    2. Operators  
    3. Functions (call by value/call by reference)  
    4. Recursion  
    5. Arrays  
    6. Pointers (very important)  
    7. OOPS (four pillars: Inheritance, Encapsulation, etc.)  
  - 🎥 Refer to this [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqM7alHXFySHm4VjV-OZgIrwdjXfCBQmI&si=QVa5xJfix5A-yEKf).  
- Know Python? It’s a perk but not mandatory.  

#### 🔟 **Protocols**  
- 📖 Read [this section on protocols](https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/tree/main/Digital/Protocols).  
- 📚 Deepen your understanding by building a small project.
