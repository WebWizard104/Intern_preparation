This section covers preparation resources for roles in  Digital design.
Main topics to cover:-
 1. Combinational and Sequential circuits, FSM, FF, Counters ,Sequence detectors and clock dividers(integer as well as non integer) 
 2. Static Time Analysis
 3.  FIFO Depth Calculation
 4. Fault Analysis and Hazards
 5. CMOS
 6. Memory (RAM - SRAM / DRAM, ROM etc.)
 7. Programmable devices
 8. Computer Organisation and Architecture
 9. Verilog
 10. Protocols

For covering point 1 you can refer  https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/Mano%20Digital%20Design%205E.pdf 
Cover till Chapter 7 and solve questions given in the last of each chapter. After building a deep understanding solve questions from https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/DIGIQS.pdf
of each chapter. Solving this pdf will make you ready to attempt medium to hard level questions of OA.

For covering point 2 , you can refer https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpCkjM331Aa8JNoZ1s1o1txve2wlf9pCP&si=RLKsbN1wS-iMU1rW this playlist . STA is one of the core concept of Digital Circuits , so get a deep understanding
of why it occurs and how can you tackle it. After watching this playlist you can practise questions of STA from https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/DIGIQS.pdf

For point 3, FIFO Depth Calculation contains some specific cases, read all the cases from  https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/fifodepthcalculationmadeeasy2%20.pdf  and practise problems for each case

For point 4, 

For point 5, refer Digital IC Design by Prof. Janakiraman - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHO2NKv71TvsSqYwVvUCZwNkY-jUyUHdS&si=SVGbxXnJIJatscRN. 
In you are constrained by time  , cover first 19 lectures and practise problems. If you have ample amount of time , you can refer to whole playlist. 

For point 6 , refer to lecture 23 - 25 of https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-8LShlBMIjUuI9beQJHZUF14we25NToB this playlist.
