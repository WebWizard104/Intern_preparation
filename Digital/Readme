This section covers preparation resources for roles in  Digital design.
Main topics to cover:-
 1. Combinational and Sequential circuits, FSM, FF, Counters ,Sequence detectors and clock dividers(integer as well as non integer) 
 2. Static Time Analysis
 3.  FIFO Depth Calculation
 4. Fault Analysis and Hazards
 5. CMOS
 6. Memory (RAM - SRAM / DRAM, ROM etc.)
 7. Programmable devices
 8. Verilog
 9. Computer Organisation and Architecture
 10. Pragramming 
 11. Protocols

For covering point 1 you can refer  https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/Mano%20Digital%20Design%205E.pdf 
Cover till Chapter 7 and solve questions given in the last of each chapter. After building a deep understanding solve questions from https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/DIGIQS.pdf
of each chapter. Solving this pdf will make you ready to attempt medium to hard level questions of OA.

For covering point 2 , you can refer https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpCkjM331Aa8JNoZ1s1o1txve2wlf9pCP&si=RLKsbN1wS-iMU1rW this playlist . STA is one of the core concept of Digital Circuits , so get a deep understanding
of why it occurs and how can you tackle it. After watching this playlist you can practise questions of STA from https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/DIGIQS.pdf

For point 3, FIFO Depth Calculation contains some specific cases, read all the cases from  https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/blob/main/Digital/fifodepthcalculationmadeeasy2%20.pdf  and practise problems for each case

For point 4, 

For point 5, refer Digital IC Design by Prof. Janakiraman - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHO2NKv71TvsSqYwVvUCZwNkY-jUyUHdS&si=SVGbxXnJIJatscRN. 
In you are constrained by time  , cover first 19 lectures and practise problems. If you have ample amount of time , you can refer to whole playlist. 

For point 6 , Either you can refer Chapter - 7 of Mano or else refer to lecture 23 - 25 of https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-8LShlBMIjUuI9beQJHZUF14we25NToB this playlist.
For point 7 , you can follow Neso Academy videos

 For point 8, If you have ample amount of time you can  follow  course by  Prof. Indranil Sen Gupta https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCrlyaXMAn8&list=PLRsFfXmDi9IYCNlvNjrsD8bLMmNE0UxBH but If you have time constraint then
 refer some syntax videos on youtube and start solving HDL problems given in last of each chapter in Morris Mano 

After you cover above points, you will be able to tackle most of the problems of Digital section of Online assesment of most of the companies. 

For point 9, If time permits you can study the full course https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-8LShlBMIjUuI9beQJHZUF14we25NToB. 
Main topics to cover from the above course :
 1.  ISA, Addressing modes
 2. CISC , RISC
 3. Performance Benchmarks
 4. Amadahl's law
 5. Memory Interfacing and Addressing
 6. Memory Hierarchy and Cache Memory(Very Imp topic, don't miss it at any cost)
 7. Pipelining
 8. Pipeline Hazards

If you have a time constraint then you can go through COA course by Gate Smashers(will be helpful to tackle questions) 
You can practise previous year Gate Problems of COA 

For point 10, if you have ample amount of time then you can do DSA but for tackling OA questions hardcore DSA is not required. 
Main topics to cover in C++:
 1. Keywords
 2. Operators
 3. Functions(call by value/ call by refrence)
 4. Recursion
 5. Array 
 6. Pointers( very imp and tricky)
 7. OOPS (four pillars of OOPS[Inheritance, Encapsulation  etc. ] )

You should also go through the syntax of C, once you are clear with the logic then language is not a barrier. 
In most of cases , code snippets are given and you have to predict the output so you can practise such type of questions. You can refer to this playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqM7alHXFySHm4VjV-OZgIrwdjXfCBQmI&si=QVa5xJfix5A-yEKf

Having a knowledge of scripting language like Python is a perk but in OA questions are not asked from a scripting language.

For point 11, you can read https://github.com/WebWizard104/Intern_preparation/tree/main/Digital/Protocols . Remember just reading  the concepts won't help much. 
Maybe do a small project on protocols and get a better understanding.


Congratulations , after completing the above topics and practising well you are ready to tackle all the questions of Digital Section of OA.
